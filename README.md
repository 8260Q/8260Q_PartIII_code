# 8260Q_PartIII_code
Code of part III Physics project

This repository includes the relevant code for the part III project of student 8260Q

The code CI in Constant_Interaction is used to calculate the capacitance moel energy given the gate voltages and capacitances of the system

The code Fock-Darwin in Stability adds single particle energies to the capacitance model energy, and creates a charge stability diagram given voltage ranges and parameter valeus.

The code LF in machine learning includes the three loss functions used in this thesis

The code Bayesian in ML is used to predict the model's parameters from a given charge stability diagram.

The code process_Bayesian in ML is used to generate graphs from data produced by Bayesian

the codes exp_data and process_exp do the same thing for experimentally measured charge stability diagrams

preprocessing of experimentally measured stability diagrams is done by the code interpolate in Utilities
